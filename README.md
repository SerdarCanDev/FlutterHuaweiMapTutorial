# hms_map_demo

An example project that shows how to use Huawei Map Kit Flutter Plugin. 

Notes before building
I removed the `agconnect-services.json` and keystore files for obvious reasons. Add your versions of these files (you can refer to the medium post) and then you can run the app by following commands:

Get the dependencies:

`flutter pub get`

Build&Run the application

`flutter run`
